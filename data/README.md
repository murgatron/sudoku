# data files

matrices are annoying to try and type in to any input, so instead they are in files that can be loaded by any of the projects in this repo. 

The files are json format, double-stacked arrays of numbers. 0 indicates an empty square. 

Dimension of the matrix & possible values will be determined at read time. 

TODO: projects will accept a command-line file prop
